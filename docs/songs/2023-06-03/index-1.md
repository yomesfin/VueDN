*After being exposed to various projects in different positions, I got lessons. It’s understandable if you find this point common sense. But, you know what? Common sense ain’t common sense sometimes! Let’s 1, 2 .. 5 them.*

## 1. Business domain

These days we have uncountable frameworks, libraries, open-source software, vibrant communities, and others.

*And that’s great.*

But, these things are not the goals by themselves. They are tools. They are designed so we can solve some problems. The thing that happens sometimes is people get too focused on them. Why? The tool is made to accomplish something. *What have you done with it?*

The first time our CTO explained our next project to me how the customers are using EXCEL and we will be digitizing the requirement into a usable web application and adding monitoring to what they are doing daily. I thought that is cool! Seriously. And he gave me 21 excel sheets and let me wonder about the database design and stuff.

Getting into what problem you are solving in the outer business domain gives you the power because you are engaging fully and whenever a new requirement change is introduced, you can analyze it watching out if it fits with the full picture.

> *Even if working in big organizations where you are not exactly working on the product as a whole, At least know how the specific part you are building fits with the overall picture. Michael Geers calls this “self Identifying” with the product.*

*So are you saying, ditch everything and go with whatever we want? Of course not!*

> The world ain’t gonna unfold every time a new ‘that’ framework or tool comes up. Just don’t be passionate about everything. It’s just another thing with additional utilities.

Obviously. tools have advantages over others. Some are helpful But don’t just stop being excited too much there. Users are interested in what problem specifically solved for them not the framework the team used.

Your technical skill must be interpreted in a way that solves real-life problems. Well, someone said :-

> In my opinion. Getting software “right” is a weird intersection of technical know-how, business savvy, creative thinking, communication, and complexity reduction/management.

*Some oversimplify the subject as choosing between the white hammer and the blue one. No tools matter. They really do. But just don’t stop there.*

In a nutshell, being the president should not be the goal rather it’s the path. It’s what you do with it. You don’t just sit there and get a s*ense of accomplishment of being a president*. It’s a path to achieve what you are being voted for. *Education is not a goal*, it’s a path to serve based on what you have learned. In religion, prayer is not a goal by itself. It’s a path to connect with God. I’m going a bit far I guess and the topic by itself can be a series of articles so let’s stop here.

## **2. Communicating Non Technical Person**

Once the project manager came out to me and asked for a list of some users from a specific company registered on our database. I began to write a bunch of SQL statements (it was PostgreSQL) and told him to give me some minutes.

The contact person from the company called him and said it was urgent. He came again and checked my progress, while he lefts the person with this info over the phone.

*“I am contacting the **technical team** to extract the data. We are almost done and will get back to you.” Not exactly but he gave such kind of response.*

Oh my, it felt so weird the first time. I thought, Seriously? Dude, what the hell *technical team*? I am the only one and this is a simple SQL statement! Later on, I thought about it and wondered about the idea ending up examining myself and realized I have gone way informal.

Come on, what was I thinking ? should he have said?

“*Since the data is stored in **PostgreSQL** database, the developer is writing an **SQL query** by joining the tables to get the data .. so and so forth”*

Imagine this for a person who probably does not have the know-how of what databases are in the first place. Weird.
